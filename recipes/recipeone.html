            <li>Put water in a pot (or milk, to make it creamier)
                and put it in the stove.
            </li>
            <li>After that, put the flour and mix it.</li>
            <li>When boiling, take it off the fire.</li>
            <li>After that, maintain the pot in the stove until
                the oatmeal is heavy
            </li>
            <li>After that, take ir of the fire, and serve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </li>
